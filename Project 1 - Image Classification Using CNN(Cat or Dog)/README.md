# Image Classifier using CNN 

I tried to build CNN model using keras to classify images. i took bunch of cats and dogs images and i trained my model. also i used keras tuner to tune hyperparameters.

After running it("CNN Classifier") for 20 epoch i got 87 percent val_accuracy. If we increase the epoch we may get even better result.

With the parameters which i got after tuning the model, i have built one more model("Tuned CNN") which gives almost similar result.
